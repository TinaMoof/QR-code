## My process
I started by writing the html code and then I styled it with css, i struggled with the text being too far from the QR image, but i tried to make it as similar and simple as i could.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned
I learned how to link a favicon and how to make a shadow as we skipped learning these back in highschool.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://w3schools.com/) - This helped me with with every code i did not know or did not remember. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
